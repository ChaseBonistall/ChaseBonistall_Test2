# Description
What I did during this test:
After opening up Github and eclipse I followed the simple instructions by opening a project board and one by one completing each of the following TestOrder tasks.
I would create a task, assign it to myself and then create a new branch, make sure I did it correctly in elcipse by fetching from the origin. 
Then i would get my branches in eclipse while adding and commmitting the code properly back into GitHub while adding the proer commit messages.
I would then pull up the pull request and make sure all my code was properly updated into my main branch,
before going back into the project board and seeing that my task was completed and then repeating these steps until every requirement in test 2 was satisfied.
